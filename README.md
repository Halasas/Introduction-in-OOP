# HoMM-like CLI battle strategy

ะก# .Net Framework 4.7.2

This project is a step-by-step battle strategy in the style of Heroes of Might And Magic for two players on one screen. Before starting a battle, players make up their armies from various units. Each unit, in addition to basic characteristics (for example, initiative, which affects the order of turns), also has special abilities and effects.
The game interface is CLI. Developed in C #, the design was focused on clean architecture and extensibility: appropriate patterns were used, support for custom modifications was implemented through reflection.
